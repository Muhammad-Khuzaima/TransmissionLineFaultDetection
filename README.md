# TransmissionLineFaultDetection
Three-Phase Line Fault Detection and Protection System was developed utilizing various machine learning algorithms. 
The system detects fault in three-phase electrical lines and trigger protective measures to ensure uninterrupted power supply 
and safeguard electrical systems. Data for algorithm development was collected from Simulink simulations 
and dedicated hardware was constructed to implement the protection system.
